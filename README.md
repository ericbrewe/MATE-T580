# MATE-T580: Practical Data Science using R </BR>(A Drexel University Course)

Welcome to MATE-T580 course portal! This repository will serve as the home page for the course. Lectures, assignments, datasets for analysis, and solutions to assignments & quizzes will be posted here. Your first order of business should be to carefully read this page to learn about the course, in terms of content, structure, and teaching methodology.  

## Overview
The course is designed as an introduction to data science for students with no prior knowledge of the subject. It covers all steps of the data science pipeline: from getting and cleaning data, to performing exploratory analysis, producing meaningful visualizations, all the way to building predictive models. Students will be introduced to some of the most powerful machine learning algorithms used in the industry, including artificial neural network (ANN) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Throughout the course, emphasis will be on the practical aspects of data science (as opposed to the theoretical/statistical aspects). Students will work with real datasets and will do a lot of coding using R/RStudio. 

## Prerequisites
Some knowledge of R is required before taking the course. To start with, I suggest completing the following courses on DataCamp:
- [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (4 hours)
- [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (6 hours)

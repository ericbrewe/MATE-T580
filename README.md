# MATE-T580: Practical Data Science using R </BR>(A Drexel University Course)

Welcome to MATE-T580 course portal! This repository will serve as the home page for the course. Lectures, assignments, datasets for analysis, and solutions to assignments & quizzes will be posted here. Your first order of business should be to carefully read this page to learn about the course, in terms of content, structure, and week-by-week plan of study.  

## Overview
MATE-T580 is designed as an introduction to data science for students with no prior knowledge of the subject. ***MATE-T580 covers all steps of the data science pipeline***: from getting and cleaning data, to performing exploratory analysis, producing meaningful visualizations, all the way to building predictive models. Students will be introduced to some of the most powerful machine learning algorithms used in the industry, including artificial neural network (ANN) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Throughout the course, emphasis will be on the practical aspects of data science (as opposed to the theoretical/statistical aspect). Students will work with real datasets and will do a lot of coding using R/RStudio. 

## Prerequisites
Some knowledge of R is required before taking the course. To start with, I suggest completing the following courses on DataCamp:
- [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (4 hours, Free)
- [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (6 hours, Premium content)

And this interactive course within R:

Note that Drexel students who are registered for the course will receive a special invitation for accessing premium content on DataCamp to complete the prerequisites. ***When signing up for DataCamp, use your Drexel shortname email*** so that your account can be linked to your Drexel identity.   

## Course structure
At its core, Data Science is a combination of coding and performing statistical analysis. As the focus of the course is on the R implementation of various Data Science techniques, the best way to learn is by doing lots of coding in R. As such, the course is structured to ensure that students complete ~100 hours of coding over the 10-week duration of the course. This is achieved through the following components:
- ***Classroom-lab hybrid***: Classroom time will be run as a lab rather than a traditional lecture. Students are required to have a laptop at all times with R and Rstudio installed on. The instructor will present certain concepts and will assign tasks for students to work on. Discussion and collaborations is encouraged.  
- ***Weekly DataCamp assignments*** (~4 hours each): A blend of mini video lectures and guided hands on exercises. The topics follow closely the topics we learn in class and thus reinforce in-class leaning and provide additional avenue for getting hands on practice in R.
- ***Bi-weekly assignments***: More challenging assignments that use real datasets and that test the students ability to apply their subject knowledge to a problem with little guidance.
- ***Capstone project***:
